#End to End Machine Learning Project
An end-to-end machine learning project encompasses the entire process of building and deploying a machine learning model, from data acquisition and preparation to model training, evaluation, and deployment.Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Problem Definition: Clearly outlining the problem you want to solve with machine learning. 
Data Acquisition and Preparation: Gathering, cleaning, and preparing the necessary data for training the model. 
Model Development: Selecting and training the appropriate machine learning model. 
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using various metrics. 
Model Deployment: Integrating the model into a production environment for real-time predictions. 
Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitoring the model's performance and making necessary adjustments.
